## Arithmetic operations:

```python
print(1 + 3) # Sum
# This prints 4

print(3 - 1) # Subtraction
# This prints 2

print(2 * 3) # Multiplication
# This prints 6

print(6 / 4) # Division
# This prints 1.5

print(6 / 2)
# This prints 3.0

print(3 ** 2) # Exponentiation
# This prints 9

print(6 // 2) # Integer division (it approximates the value)
# This prints 3

print(6 // 4)
# This prints 1

print(-6 // 4)
# This print -2
```

## Comparison Operators

```python
print(1 > 3) # Greater than
# This prints False

print(1 < 3) # Less than
# This prints True

print(1 <= 3) # Less or equal than
# This prints True

print(1 >= 3) # Greater or equal than
# This prints False

print(1 == 5) # Equal to
# This prints False

print(1 != 3) # Different to
# This prints True
```

## Logical Operators

```python
print(True and False) # Evaluates if all statements are True
# This prints False

print(True or False) # Evaluates if at least one of the statements is True
# This prints True

print(not False) # Flips a boolean value
# This prints True
```
